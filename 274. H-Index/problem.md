## Question statement

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `i`^th^ paper, return the *researcher's h-index*.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

## Example:
**Input:**
    citations = [3,0,6,1,5]

**Output:**
    3

**Explanation:**

`[3,0,6,1,5]` means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has *3 papers* with **at least** *3 citations* each, their h-index is `3`.

**Constraints:**
* `n == citations.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5000`
* `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
