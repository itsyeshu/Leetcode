## Question statement

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the *majority element*.

The majority element is the element that appears `more than n / 2` times. You may assume that the **majority element always exists** in the array.

## Example:
**Input:**
    nums = [3,2,3]

**Output:**
    3

**Constraints:**
* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
* `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
