# 55. Jump Game

>**Note :** This problem can be found at [Leetcode â§‰](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/).

## Question statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` *if you can reach the last index*, *or* `false` *otherwise*.

 
## Example:
**Input:**
    nums = [3,2,1,0,4]

**Output:**
    false

**Explanation:**
You will always arrive at index `3` no matter what. Its maximum jump length is `0`, which makes it impossible to reach the `last index`.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
