Hello Leetcoders, I provide solutions in C++ to `Leetcode problems`, `Daily code competition`. If this repo helped you, please give it a star and don't forget to fork this repo and follow me.

## Folder structure
```

|___ 123. Problem from Leetcode
  |___ problem.md
  |___ hint.md
  |___ solution.cpp
  |___ try_me.cpp
```

`123.  Problem from Leetcode` directory represents the problem title. Inside this directory, you will find the problem statement and hint at `problem.md` and `hint.md` respectively.

`solution.cpp` is the solution file that can be used to pass all tests in Leetcode. While to run the file locally, use `try_me.cpp` file.


## How to:
1. Read `problem.md` first. You have problem statement, Leetcode problem link, example and contraints in `problem.md`.
2. Then read `hint.md` to get hints.
3. Try out the solution in `try_me.cpp`.
4. If you need help, copy the contents of `solution.cpp` and paste in Leetcode.
