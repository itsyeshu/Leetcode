# 1575. Count All Possible Routes 

>**Note :** This problem can be found at [Leetcode â§‰](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-all-possible-routes/description/).

## Question statement

You are given an array of distinct positive integers locations where `locations[i]` represents the position of city `i`. You are also given integers start, `finish` and `fuel` representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.

At each step, if you are at city i, you can pick any city j such that `j != i` and `0 <= j < locations.length` and move to city `j`. Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

Notice that `fuel` cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit any city more than once (including `start` and `finish`).

Return the *count of all possible routes* from `start` to `finish`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Example:
**Input:**
    locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5

**Output:**
    4

**Explanation:**
The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
```
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
```

**Constraints:**
* `2 <= locations.length <= 100`
* `1 <= locations[i] <= 109`
* All integers in `locations` are distinct.
* `0 <= start`, `finish < locations.length`
* `1 <= fuel <= 200`
